<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project serves as a hands-on learning experience to learn about Modern Website Design, ReactJS and TailwindCSS, showcasing the transformative capabilities of GPT-3, an AI
language model equipped with a staggering 175 billion parameters. This website offers an
immersive exploration into the world of advanced AI-driven language understanding and generation. From crafting
compelling content to tackling intricate coding tasks, we invite you to join us in this educational endeavor, where we
bridge the gap between theory and practice, enabling you to harness the remarkable potential of AI for your own learning
and growth.

By building this project, I am able to learn to work with new concepts such as:

* Structuring of a create-react-app project
* Using ReactJS to create modern design landing pages
* Creative Writing to promote the use of GPT-3 to business
* Using CSS Frameworks such as Tailwind CSS
